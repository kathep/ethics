summary: Updated version of the method, as presented in the first draft of the Make Me Care paper, presented at HCII DUXU 2020 and published in the HCII Conference Proceedings. This version is adjusted to accommodate the workflows and perspectives of data scientists and scientists. This version was influenced by conversations at and reflections on visits to the Applied University of the Arts in Bern, Switzerland, PolyPoly in Berlin, Germany, Svelte Studios in Adelaide, Australia, the University of the Creative Arts, London, United Kingdom, ALOU, Ljubljana, Slovenia, and Humboldt University, Berlin, Germany. It was also influenced by insights gained while teaching Taming Treacherous Data at the Digital Humanities Summer Institute at the University of Victoria, Victoria, Canada.
