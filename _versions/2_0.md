summary: First public release of the poster under CC-BY Creative Commons licensing. This version was influenced by conversations at and reflections on the MyDataGlobal conference in Helsinki, Finland, in September, and visits to Konstfact in Stockholm and Malardalen University in Eskilstuna, Sweden. Designing the poster also resulted in changes to the method. It was also influenced by insights gained while teaching Taming Treacherous Data at the Digital Humanities Summer Institute at the University of Victoria, Victoria, Canada.
