summary: Development of a poster communicating the workflow steps to non-expert audiences. It includes slightly altered language and steps for a more general audience. While the students did an excellent job designing the poster, some of the language they used was not ethical. Therefore, this version is not shared publicly.

The poster was inspired by [Dave Maas](https://www.eff.org/about/staff/dave-maass), from Electronic Frontier Foundation. In his duties as a visiting professor at the [University of Nevada, Reno](https://www.unr.edu/) in May 2018, we talked about ethical visualization and he read an in-press copy of Racism in the Machine. He asked for the figure of the workflow from the paper 'to stick on his wall'. I realised in that moment that the workflow itself did not follow ethical data visualization principles, was not in a format to be easily shared or understood, and might be of interest to other people who want to pin it on their walls.

In May 2018, the first version of the ethical visualization poster was produced by Aras Diler, Kacee Johnson, and Sarah Krutz, as a class project for [JOUR648 Data Visualization for Social Engagement](http://kathep.com/teach/archive/data/data-2019-spring/) at the University of Nevada, Reno.
