# Carcereal Tech Community Principles

- **abolition, in both principle and effect.**   
  reform and oversight conscript us into the work of adjudicating harm and administering carceral power.

  *// obstruct, injunct, ban, prohibit, dismantle, and abolish.*

  we demand, without reservation, the abolition of carceral systems, and call for an immediate end to the design, experimentation, and rollout of these tech.

  we work towards the safety and liberation of all bodies we are in community with—land, water, plants, and beings.

  for us, it is abolition in principle and effect.

- **build power with—not on behalf of, and certainly not over.**  
  when confronting the vastness and complexity of carceral systems, model reforms and abstract scholarly concepts can offer relief.

  but these strategies also position expertise and control in the hands of lawyers, academics, and technologists.

  *// sustainable community power requires centering those directly impacted by carceral infrastructure.*

  ctrn centers community knowledge and ways of knowing. we work to empower system-impacted communities to respond effectively to program rollouts.

  we build power with—not on behalf of, and certainly not over.

- **leverage local power, lift up local organizing.**
  carceral systems implicate a wide range of actors, all with different (at times competing) incentives, and who represent diverse domains of policy, science, and industry.

  frontline organizers have learned, however, that the contexts in which carceral tech manifest are highly specific and particular to the cities and spaces they are deployed in.

  *// effective organizing against carceral tech requires mobilizing against the acquisition, operationalization, and rationale for use that’s sanctioned at a local scale.*

  we commit to finding ways to lift up and amplify the power of those on the frontlines of resistance.

- **demand safety, demand accountability, demand reparations.**
  the intent to cause harm is inherent to all carceral systems, as is the incentive to profit from that harm.

  although carceral tech are experimental, and the science behind them conjectural, the harm they inflict is actual.

  we demand reparations as these programs are rolled back and their so-called science debunked.

  *// our work extends beyond the lifespan of individual tech or databases.*

  all permutations and adaptations of deprecated programs must be terminated, and we demand full accountability and redress for the harm they have caused.
