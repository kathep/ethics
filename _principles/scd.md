# Society Centered Design manifesto

- **PUT CARE FIRST**
  If we put care first and at the center of our efforts, we can move away from delivering solely for individual and commercial interests. Care lets us deliver for public health and the planet through compassion and reciprocity.

- **EARN TRUST**
  As more of our lives are connected, we need to create systems that earn trust with people. Products, services, and standards that can be open, resilient and promote citizen empowerment.

- **EMPOWER COLLECTIVE AGENCY**
  Empowering collective agency starts with radical inclusion of the most vulnerable. We should be creating a new civic commons by making economic opportunity for the many.

- **REIMAGINE PUBLIC VALUE**
  We can create new resources and standards that favour the civic commons and public health over commercial value and the success of the few.

- **DESIGN FOR PEOPLE’S RIGHTS**  
  Design is a political act and it’s our responsibility to design for people’s rights. Privacy is not a luxury for those that can afford it. Privacy is a human right. We must create systems that remove the imbalance of power and instead promote equity and citizen empowerment.

- **ENSURE FAIR AND JUST OVERSIGHT**  
  Without fairness and justice we cannot have equity. Too often, “the commons” is shorthand for “the majority”. So we need to place mechanisms for fair and just oversight inside our design systems, so society can hold the powerful to account.

- **RE­DISTRIBUTE THE POWER OF TECHNOLOGY**  
  The web is the greatest single distribution platform ever created. As a result, it has an outsized impact on everything, including causing harm to the most vulnerable and excluded. Design must seek to redistribute that power for citizen empowerment and equity.

- **CREATE COMPASSION AT SCALE**  
  AI and automation are rapidly changing the world. But currently they're focused on commercial goals rather than societal needs. We have an opportunity to reshape AI and automation so they create equity and reinforce civic commons. People must be in control, always.

- **DESIGN FOR REGENERATIVE ACTION**  
  The climate emergency is an existential threat to humanity. We need to shift narratives and focus away from abundance and scarcity to regeneration. We need sustainable and regenerative design and business models for society for public health, and for the planet.

- **CONFRONT UNCERTAINTY**  
  The issues we face are intertwined, complex and ever-shifting. We live in radical times. And radical times require radical solutions. Doing nothing only favors a deadly status quo: we must act boldly and defiantly.
