# Detroit Digital Justice Coalition Principles

To develop the principles that would guide our work, the DDJC conducted a series of interviews amongst our founding members. The interviews explored how coalition members were using media and technology for community organizing or grassroots economic development and to describe their vision for "digital justice" in Detroit. We developed digital justice principles from common themes that emerged in these interviews. These principles have informed community technology projects all over the world. See the principles translated into French here.

- **ACCESS**
  - Digital justice ensures that all members of our community have equal access to media and technology, as producers as well as consumers.
  - Digital justice provides multiple layers of communications infrastructure in order to ensure that every member of the community has access to life-saving emergency information.
  - Digital justice values all different languages, dialects and forms of communication.

- **PARTICIPATION**
  - Digital justice prioritizes the participation of people who have been traditionally excluded from and attacked by media and technology.
  - Digital justice advances our ability to tell our own stories, as individuals and as communities.
  - Digital justice values non-digital forms of communication and fosters knowledge-sharing across generations.
  - Digital justice demystifies technology to the point where we can not only use it, but create our own technologies and participate in the decisions that will shape communications infrastructure.

- **COMMON OWNERSHIP**
  - Digital justice fuels the creation of knowledge, tools and technologies that are free and shared openly with the public.
