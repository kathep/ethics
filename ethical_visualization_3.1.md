## The steps

### A. DISCOVERY | Discover the data

- **Investigate through analysis**  
    *What can you find in the data using reason-led investigation?*


- **Explore through play**  
    *What can you find in the data using intuition-led exploration?*


### B. IMPACT | Scope the Impact

- **Assess stakes**  
    *What is at stake in this visualization effort?*


- **Establish purpose**  
    *What is your motivation for sharing what you discovered in this data?*


- **Identify intended and unintended audiences**  
    *Who do you want your visualization to reach the most?*


- **Determine impact type**  
    *Which impact type will be most effective for your audiences?*


### C. FRAME | Develop the frame

- **Empathize with audiences**  
    *What are your audiences’ greatest needs?*


- **Formulate goal**  
    *What is the goal for the visualization?*


- **Create frame**  
    *What kind of frame best achieves this goal?*


- **Review frame literature**  
    *What does the literature say about this frame?*

### D. DATASET | Prepare the dataset

- **Combine sources**  
    *What sources will you draw from?*


- **Improve veracity**  
    *Will the data hold up under scrutiny?*


- **Structure data**  
    *Is the dataset intelligible and navigable?*


- **Refine frame**  
    *How does the frame need to be adjusted?*

### E. VISUALIZE | Visualize the frame

- **Review visualization ethics literature**  
    *What are the latest ethical recommendations?*


- **Determine context**  
    *What is the most appropriate media context for your frame?*


- **Design visualization**  
    *What design decisions will visualize the frame effectively?*


- **Test frame**  
    *Does your visualization communicate the frame?*

### F. PUBLISH | Publish the visualization

- **Release visualization**  
    *Will publishing base data do harm to any intended or unintended audience?*


- **Show process & affiliations**  
    *How can your ethical process be best demonstrated?*


- **Measure impact**  
    *What is the felt impact of your published visualization?*


- **Feedback results**  
    *How do the visualization’s intended impact and felt impact compare?*

## Roles
Ethically visualizing data is a team effort, requiring multiple roles that have traditionally been associated with vastly different disciplinary traditions and siloes of knowledge. Four recommended roles outlined below. Some of these skill areas may be found in more than one person. One or more people may fill each role. The more recipients are involved in the process, the better.

- **Audience**  
  A person or people who from, or are as close as possible to, the intended audience(s). Co-creation is key to impact.  
  *Includes:* readers, participants, users and/or viewers
- **Data wrangler**  
  A person with skill at cleaning, processing, and structuring data for visual display.  
  *Includes:* computer scientist, data analyst, digital humanist, and/or statistician  
- **Subject expert**  
  A person with in-depth subject expertise.  
  *Includes:* academic, community organizer, public official and/or scientist
- **Visual storyteller**  
  A person with skill at ethically simplifying information and communicating it using visual means.  
  *Includes:* communication designer, game designer, graphic recorder, illustrator, and/or journalist

**A. DISCOVERY**  
*Lead by:* Subject expert  
*For:* Subject expert

**B. IMPACT**  
*Lead by:* Visual storyteller  
*For:* Audience

**C. FRAME**  
*Lead by:* Audience  
*For:* Data wrangler

**D. DATASET**  
*Lead by:* Data wrangler  
*For:* Visual storyteller

**E. VISUALIZE**  
*Lead by:* Visual storyteller  
*For:* Subject expert

**F. PUBLISH**  
*Lead by:* Subject expert  
*For:* Audience
