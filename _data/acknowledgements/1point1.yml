  contribution: The poster was inspired by Dave Maas. In his duties as a visiting professor at the University of Nevada, Reno in May 2018, we talked about ethical visualization and he read an in-press copy of Racism in the Machine. He asked for the figure of the workflow from the paper ‘to stick on his wall’. I realised in that moment that the workflow itself did not follow ethical data visualization principles, was not in a format to be easily shared or understood, and might be of interest to other people who want to pin it on their walls.

  contribution: Worked on the first version of the ethical visualization poster as a class project for JOUR648 Data Visualization for Social Engagement. While the student group did an excellent job designing the poster, some of the language they used was not ethical. Therefore, this version is not shared publicly.
