## The steps

### A. DISCOVERY | Discover the data

**Roles**
*Lead by:* Subject expert 
*For:* Subject expert

- **Investigate through analysis**\
    *What can you find in the data using reason-led investigation?*
    
    
- **Explore through play**_
    *What can you find in the data using intuition-led exploration?*


### B. IMPACT | Scope the Impact 

**Roles**  
*Lead by:* Visual storyteller
*For:* Audience

- **Assess stakes**<br>

- **Establish purpose**  
    *What is your motivation for sharing what you discovered in this data?*


- **Identify intended and unintended audiences**
    *Who do you want your visualization to reach the most?*


- **Determine impact type**
    *Which impact type will be most effective for your audiences?*


### C. FRAME | Develop the frame

**Roles**  
*Lead by:* Audience
*For:* Data wrangler

- **Empathize with audience**
    *What are your audiences’ greatest needs?*
    
    
- **Formulate goal**
    *What is the goal for the visualization?*

    *What kind of frame best achieves this goal?*
    
    
- **Review frame literature**
    *What does the literature say about this frame?*

### D. DATASET | Prepare the dataset 

**Roles**  
*Lead by:* Data wrangler
*For:* Visual storyteller

- **Combine sources**
    *What sources will you draw from?*
    
    
- **Improve veracity**
    *Will the data hold up under scrutiny?*
    
    
- **Structure data**
    *Is the dataset intelligible and navigable?*
    
    
- **Refine frame**
    *How does the frame need to be adjusted?*

### E. VISUALIZE | Visualize the frame

**Roles**  
*Lead by:* Visual storyteller
*For:* Subject expert

- **Review visualization ethics literature**
    *What are the latest ethical recommendations?*
    
    
- **Determine context**
    *What is the most appropriate media context for your frame?*
    
    
- **Design visualization**
    *What design decisions will visualize the frame effectively?*
    
    
- **Test frame**
    *Does your visualization communicate the frame?*

### F. PUBLISH | Publish the visualization

**Roles**  
*Lead by:* Subject expert
*For:* Audience

    *Will publishing base data do harm to any intended or unintended audience?*
    
    
- **Show process & affiliations**
    *How can your ethical process be best demonstrated?*
    
    
- **Measure impact**

## Roles
Ethically visualizing data is a team effort, requiring multiple roles that have traditionally been associated with vastly different disciplinary traditions and siloes of knowldge. Four recommended roles outlined below. Some of these skill areas may be found in more than one person. One or more people may fill each role. The more receipients are involved in the process, the better. 

- **Subject expert**
  A person with in-depth subject expertise.
  *Includes:* academic, community organizer, and/or public official
- **Visual storyteller** 
  A person with skill at ethically simplifying information and communicating it using visual means.
  *Includes:* communication designer, game designer, graphic recorder, illustrator,  and/or journalist
- **Audience**
  A person or people who are as close to the intended audience(s) as possible. Co-creation is key to impact.
  *Includes:* readers, participants, users and/or viewers
- **Data wrangler**
  *Includes:* data analyst, digital humanist, librarian, and/or statistician
